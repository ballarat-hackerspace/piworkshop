Analog
======
1. Introduce a temperature/humidity sensor
2. Show wiring information and how it works
3. Connect to pi
4. Write a Python Script to read input data and print out


Web Servers
===========

1. Create a basic flask webserver
2. Create an API
3. Hook up the API to the sensor, to show current temperature/humidity


Exercise
========

1. Give each student an ultrasonic sensor and wiring instructions
2. Wire the sensor up, and read distance information via pi
3. Expose that information to a web server
4. Create a web API that controls a servo motor to set a flag "up" or "down"
5. When in up position, it is in front of the ultrasonic sensor -- check API to confirm
