Raspberry Pi Workshop
=====================

Welcome
TODO: Welcome image


Overview of the Raspberry Pi
============================

- The Raspberry Pi is a single-board computer, containing a CPU, memory and other things necessary to be a fully functional computer.
- The Raspberry Pi 2 was recently released, and is the "official" model for this workshop. It has 1GB ram, and a 900MHz quad core processor!
- No hard drive, optical drive, keyboard, mouse, monitor or wireless - these are all things you plug in later (SD card for hard drive)
- Do you have a different model? If so, let us know.

- Introduces programming and electronics
- Expert in a topic we are covering? Help others, or go exploring?

Format
======

- 2 hour guided learning each week
- Lots of self-discovery opportunity (we are a hackerspace afterwall)

(Introduce yourselves)


This week
=========

Topic: Your Pi

- Hour 1: Overview of the Pi, and setting up your new (or old) Pi
- Hour 2: Programming with Python

Raspberry Pi Foundation
=======================
- The Raspberry Pi Foundation was formed in 2009 to develop a low cost computer
- The goal was to promote computer science in schools, and the Raspberry Pi computer was the tool to do that
- Five models released so far: Model A, A+, B, B+ and Raspberry Pi 2.

Operating Systems
=================
- Like any computer, it needs an operating system to do anything useful
- [There are many, many options](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/)
- We will be using Raspbian, a Debian-based Linux Distro.
- Others include Noobs, Ubuntu, and uh... Windows 10 IoT.
- To use, you download the image, create a bootable SD card, and then power on the Pi with that SD card in.


Creating a Bootable SD Card
===========================

1. Download the Raspbian image from our local store: TODO: bhack store of Raspbian
2. "Burn" a bootable SD card:
	- Windows: Use [Win32DiskImager](http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/)
	- Linux (command line): [See instructions on Pi's page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md)
	- Ubuntu: Use ImageWriter
	- Red Hat: TODO @firnsy
	- Mac: [See official instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md)

**Note:** Command line tools use dd, which is one of the most efficient ways to accidentally delete all your data. Be careful with the commands!


GUI
===
- startx
- Opening the terminal
