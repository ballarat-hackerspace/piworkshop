Controlling the world
=====================
1. Outline the Pi's input and output options
2. Introduce the GPIO pins, and the different types
3. Connect an LED to a pin (no breadboard yet)
4. Use a Python script to turn it on/off via code
5. Connect a button to a different pin
6. Python script uses button state to control LED state
7. Introduce breadboard, how it works, and then connect LED/button to it
8. Step through some basic circuits with the Pi connected to a breadboard

Exercise
========
1. Build a simple breadboard holder - pi on one side, breadboard on another. Students given a schema and materials
2. Give each student a 2 x 16 LCD screen (+ components needed to make it work)
3. Give students a connector document and get them to connect the components themselves
4. Write a Python script to control the screen (introduce library to do so)
